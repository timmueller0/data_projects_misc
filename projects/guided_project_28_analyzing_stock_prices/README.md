# Analyzing Stock Prices

In this project, we'll work with stock market data downloaded from [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/) using the [yahoo_finance](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/yahoo-finance) Python package. This data consists of the daily stock prices from `2007-1-1` to `2017-04-17` for several hundred stock symbols traded on the [NASDAQ](http://www.nasdaq.com/) stock exchange, stored in the prices folder. We used the `download_data.py` script in the same folder as the Jupyter notebook to download all of the stock price data. 

## Data Files
The project used a database (including datafiles) made available by [Dataquest.io](https://www.dataquest.io/). The code in the Jupyter notebook shows how to connect to that database. 

## Instructions

Download or clone this repository.
Ensure that the data files are located in the `Data/` directory.
Open the Jupyter Notebook `Guided Project 27 - Analyzing Wikipedia Pages.ipynb` and run the cells to reproduce the analysis.

## Project Notebook

You can also directly view or run the analysis in the [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/timmueller0/data_projects_misc/blob/main/projects/guided_project_27_analyzing_wikipedia_pages/Guided%20Project%2027%20-%20Analyzing%20Wikipedia%20Pages.ipynb)
