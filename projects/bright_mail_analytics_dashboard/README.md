# The BrightMail Analytics Dashboard

Just to play around a bit with Tableau Public and in order to show that one can make kind of nice-looking dashboards even in the free version of Tableau, I created this dashboard. BrightMail Analytics is a small fictional SaaS company offering an email newsletter product. The dashboard visualizes key performance indicators (KPIs) to help businesses track their financial health and customer dynamics more effectively.
I'm providing the underlying simulated datasets here, in case anyone is interested in building a dashboard on their own based on this data.


## Data Files

This project includes the following data files:

- `customer_data.csv`: The customer list with 1000 entries.
- `active_user_data.csv`: A file containing end-of-month counts of daily active users. In this case, users are not customers of BrightMail Analytics, but users of the newsletters that are being created using the company's tool.
- `monthly_user_data.csv`: Same as active_user_data, but the counts are monthly active users.
- `marketing_data.csv`: A file listing the monthly marketing channels, amounts spent, number of impressions, clicks, and conversions.
- `revenue_data.csv`: Contains sign-up dates, the kind of plan the customers are subscribed to, monthly revenue per customer and activity status.

### Instructions

You can download the Tableau File and load it into Tableau Public. Of course you will also have to connect the csv files accordingly.

Actually, you can also just view the dashboard at [Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/tim.m.ller8434/viz/BrightMailAnalyticsv2/Dashboard1).
