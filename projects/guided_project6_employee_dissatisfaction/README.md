# Clean and Analyze Employee Exit Surveys

In this project, we'll work with exit surveys from employees of the [Department of Education, Training and Employment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Education_and_Training_(Queensland)) (DETE) and the Technical and Further Education (TAFE) institute in Queensland, Australia. You can find the DETE exit survey data [here](https://data.gov.au/dataset/ds-qld-fe96ff30-d157-4a81-851d-215f2a0fe26d/details?q=exit%20survey). The original TAFE exit survey data is no longer available. We've made some slight modifications to the original datasets to make them easier to work with, including changing the encoding to `UTF-8` (the original ones are encoded using `cp1252`.)

We want to answer the following questions:

* Are employees who only worked for the institutes for a short period of time resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction? What about employees who have been there longer?
* Are younger employees resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction? What about older employees?
