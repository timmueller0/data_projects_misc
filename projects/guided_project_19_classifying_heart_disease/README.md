# Classifying Heart Disease

We'll also be looking at the [Heart Disease Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Heart+Disease) from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. This dataset comes from the Cleveland Clinic Foundation, which recorded information on various patient characteristics, including age and chest pain, to try to classify the presence of heart disease in an individual using Logistic Regression.

## Data Files

This project includes the following data files:

- `heart_disease.csv`: Cleveland Clinic Heart Disease Data

### Instructions

1. Download or clone this repository.
2. Ensure that the data files are located in the `Data/` directory.
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook `Guided_project_19 - Classifying Heart Disease.ipynb` and run the cells to reproduce the analysis.

### Project Notebook

You can also directly view or run the analysis in the [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/timmueller0/data_projects_misc/blob/main/projects/guided_project13_building_a_spam_filter_with_naive_bayes/Guided_project_13%20-%20Building%20a%20Spam%20Filter%20with%20Naive%20Bayes.ipynb)
