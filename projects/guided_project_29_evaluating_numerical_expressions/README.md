# Evaluating Numerical Expressions

In this project, we will use stacks to implement an algorithm that can evaluate numerical expressions.
However, calculating the result of a complex numerical expression isn't something that a computer processor can do right out of the box. Behind the scenes, Python uses an algorithm to evaluate this expression.
The goal of this project is to use the stack data structure that we've worked with before to implement an algorithm that can evaluate complex numerical expressions.
By the end of this project, we'll know how to implement a function named `evaluate()` that can evaluate expressions stored in string.

## Data Files
In fact, this project uses no data. It's about parsing and executing numeric expressions and operations.

## Instructions

Download or clone this repository.
Open the Jupyter Notebook `Guided Project 29 - Evaluating Numerical Expressions.ipynb` and run the cells to reproduce the analysis.

## Project Notebook

You can also directly view or run the analysis in the [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/timmueller0/data_projects_misc/blob/main/projects/guided_project_29_evaluating_numerical_expressions/Guided%20Project%2029%20-%20Evaluating%20Numerical%20Expressions.ipynb)
