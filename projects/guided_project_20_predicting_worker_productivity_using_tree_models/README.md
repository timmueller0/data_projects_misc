# Predicting Employee Productivity Using Tree Models 
In this project, we'll be working with the dataset *Productivity Prediction of Garment Employees*. The original dataset is in the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Productivity+Prediction+of+Garment+Employees). We will try to classify workers' productivity and predicting which productivity class they belong to. We will use classification trees for this task.
We are tasked with using the dataset to accurately predict the likelihood of a new patient having heart disease in the future.
