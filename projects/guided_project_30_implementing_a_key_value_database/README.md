# Implementing a Key-Value Database

In this project, we'll use the B-tree data structure from before as a building block for a fully functioning key-value store.

A key-value store is a database that operates similar to a Python dictionary. Our key-value store will work like a Python dictionary, but it will also allow users to perform range queries. Our goal will be to create an easy-to-use, flexible, and adaptable key value store that other developers could use in their projects.

We will use the `BTree` class developed previously and continuously extend its functionality.

## Data Files
The project used a database (including datafiles) made available by [Dataquest.io](https://www.dataquest.io/). The code in the Jupyter notebook shows how to connect to that database. 

## Instructions

Download or clone this repository.
Ensure that the data files are located in the Data/ directory.
Open the Jupyter Notebook `Guided_project_24 -Building a database for crime reports.ipynb` and run the cells to reproduce the analysis.

## Project Notebook

You can also directly view or run the analysis in the [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/timmueller0/data_projects_misc/blob/main/projects/guided_project_24_building_a_database_for_crime_reports/Guided_project_24%20-Building%20a%20database%20for%20crime%20reports.ipynb)
