# Winning Jeopardy

Jeopardy is a popular TV show in the US where participants answer questions to win money. It's been running for many years, and is a major force in popular culture. 

Imagine that we want to compete on Jeopardy, and we're looking for any way to win. In this project, we'll work with a dataset of Jeopardy questions to figure out some patterns in the questions that could help us win.

The dataset is named `jeopardy.csv`, and contains 20000 rows from the beginning of a full dataset of Jeopardy questions, which can be downloaded [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/datasets/comments/1uyd0t/200000_jeopardy_questions_in_a_json_file).
