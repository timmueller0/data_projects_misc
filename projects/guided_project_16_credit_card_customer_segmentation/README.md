# Credit Card Customer Segmentation

In this project, we’ll assume we are working for a credit card company. The dataset contains information about the company’s clients and we're asked to help segment them into different groups in order to apply different business strategies for each type of customer. 

For instance, the company could provide higher credit limits for customers that use the card a lot, but spend little money, or even create incentives for those with high income who don't use the card as much as the company expects. In order to apply different strategies, the company needs different groups of customers. We will use the K-means algorithm for this.

We will go through the following steps:

- Analyze the dataset;
- Prepare the data for modeling;
- Find an appropriate number of clusters;
- Segment the data;
- Interpret and explain the results.
