# Building Fast Queries on a CSV

For this project, we will assume that we own an online laptop store and want to build a way to answer a few different business questions about our inventory.

We will use the 'laptops.csv' file as our inventory. This CSV file was adapted from the [Laptop Prices dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/muhammetvarl/laptop-price).
