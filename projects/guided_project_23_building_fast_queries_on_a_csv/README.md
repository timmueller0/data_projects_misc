# Building Fast Queries on a CSV

For this project, we will assume that we own an online laptop store and want to build a way to answer a few different business questions about our inventory.

We will use the 'laptops.csv' file as our inventory. This CSV file was adapted from the [Laptop Prices dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/muhammetvarl/laptop-price). 

## Data Files

This project includes the following data files:

`laptops.csv`: Laptop Prices dataset. [Laptop Prices dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/muhammetvarl/laptop-price). 

## Instructions

Download or clone this repository.
Ensure that the data files are located in the Data/ directory.
Open the Jupyter Notebook `Guided_project_23 - Building Fast Queries on a CSV.ipynb` and run the cells to reproduce the analysis.
