# Predicting heart disease

The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that 17.9 million people die from cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) every year.

There are multiple risk factors that could contribute to CVD in an individual, such as unhealthy diet, lack of physical activity, or mental illness. Identifying these risk factors early on could help prevent many premature deaths.

Let's assume we are working for an R&D company that focuses on providing healthcare solutions. The company has collected anonymized data from multiple hospitals on several patients. The [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/heart-failure-prediction) includes relevant information for each patient, such as their personal information and some medical data, including whether or not they have had heart disease before.

We are tasked with using the dataset to accurately predict the likelihood of a new patient having heart disease in the future.

## Data Files

This project includes the following data files:

- `heart.csv`: Heart disease data

### Instructions

1. Download or clone this repository.
2. Ensure that the data files are located in the `Data/` directory.
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook `Guided_project_13 - Building a Spam Filter with Naive Bayes.ipynb` and run the cells to reproduce the analysis.
