# Exploring Financial Data using Nasdaq Data Link API

In this project, we'll integrate our skills of making API requests, extracting specific data, and transforming it into useful formats to perform practical data extraction and analysis using a financial dataset. We will use data that's being provided via the [Nasdaq Data Link API](https://docs.data.nasdaq.com/docs/in-depth-usage-1). It provides a gateway to a wide range of financial data sets, including comprehensive metrics on various companies. We will focus on the `MER/F1` datatable, which contains detailed financial information such as balance sheets, cash flow statements, and income statements.

We will extract financial data for a specific set of companies, with an emphasis on understanding their financial performance over time. We'll be looking at metrics like Accrued Expenses Turnover and exploring how these values differ among companies and regions.

**Our goal:** To perform a detailed analysis of this financial data, including trend analysis and comparative studies, We will utilize Python for data retrieval, cleaning, and analysis, and create visualizations to present our findings effectively.
