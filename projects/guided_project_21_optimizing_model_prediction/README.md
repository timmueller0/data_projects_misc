# Optimizing Model Prediction

In this project we want to optimize a model step-by-step using various optimization methods. Our reference model will be a standard linear regression model, and our machine learning task will be to predict the extent of fire damage to a forest. Our data comes from the [Forest Fires](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Forest+Fires) dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. This dataset contains information on fires, along with the resulting damage and associated meteorological data. We want to know how these characteristics might be useful in predicting future fire damage. 

## Data Files

This project includes the following data files:

`fires.csv`: Wild Fires in Portugal Dataset (There are differences in comparison to the original UCI Dataset.)

## Instructions

Download or clone this repository.
Ensure that the data files are located in the Data/ directory.
Open the Jupyter Notebook `Guided_project_21 - Optimizing Model Prediction.ipynb` and run the cells to reproduce the analysis.

## Project Notebook

You can also directly view or run the analysis in the [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/timmueller0/data_projects_misc/blob/main/projects/guided_project_21_optimizing_model_prediction/Guided_project_21%20-%20Optimizing%20Model%20Prediction.ipynb)
