## Exploring eBay Car Sales Data

In this guided project, we'll work with a dataset of used cars from eBay Kleinanzeigen, a classifieds section of the German eBay website.

The dataset was originally scraped and uploaded to Kaggle by user orgesleka.
The original dataset isn't available on Kaggle anymore, but you can find it [here](https://data.world/data-society/used-cars-data).

This dataset has only 50,000 datapoints sampled from the original, and some errors have been added. After all, this is a guided project to learn data cleaning. The aim of this project is to clean the dataset and perform some initial analysis on it.

### Project Notebook

You can directly view or run the analysis in the [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/timmueller0/data_projects_misc/blob/main/projects/guided_project3_ebay_car_sales/Guided_project3%20-%20eBay%20car%20sales.ipynb).
