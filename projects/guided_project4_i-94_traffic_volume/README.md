## Analysing Traffic on the Interstate 94 (I-94) Highway
The goal of our analysis is to determine a few indicators of heavy traffic on I-94. These indicators can be weather type, time of the day, time of the week, etc. For instance, we may find out that the traffic is usually heavier in the summer or when it snows. We will use various data visualisation techniques for this.
We're going to analyse a dataset about the westbound traffic on the I-94 Interstate highway.
John Hogue made the dataset available, and you can download it from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

## Data Files

This project includes the following data files:

- `Data/Metro_Interstate_Traffic_Volume.csv`: Contains the analysis dataset.

### Instructions

1. Download or clone this repository.
2. Ensure that the data files are located in the `Data/` directory.
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook `ios_android_apps.ipynb` and run the cells to reproduce the analysis.

### Project Notebook

You can also directly view or run the analysis in the [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/timmueller0/data_projects_misc/blob/main/projects/guided_project2_hacker_news_posts/Guided_project2%20-%20Hacker%20News%20posts.ipynb).
