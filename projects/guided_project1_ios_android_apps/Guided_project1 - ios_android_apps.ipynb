    "For this project, we'll pretend we're working as data analysts for a company that builds Android and iOS mobile apps. We make our apps available on Google Play and in the App Store.\n",
    "\n",
    "We only build apps that are free to download and install, and our main source of revenue consists of in-app ads. This means that the number of users of our apps determines our revenue for any given app — the more users who see and engage with the ads, the better. Our goal for this project is to analyze data to help our developers understand what type of apps are likely to attract more users.\n"

We saw that by far the most number of apps are Games and Entertainment in the iOS app store (ca. 2/3 of all apps), but when it comes to the number of users, we see that apps in the genres Navigation, Reference and Social Networking draw the most users. But these are genres, which only represent a fraction of all apps, but dominating the user counts.\n",

And building yet another social networking app will probably not work that well, given that that market might already be saturated. However, we might be able to enter the Reference genre, since there are plenty of free reference books out there with no licensing fees, and we can add features from this genre together (easy searching, look up words, good readability, audio feaures, etc.) to make for a compelling app that is nor a game.\n"

In the category video players we find the list dominated by the YouTube app (1,000,000,000+ installs). In the SOCIAL category, there are apps like Facebook and Facebook Lite, Tumblr, Google+ installed on many android phones.

The REFERENCE AND BOOKS genre in the android store is not among the most popular apps according to average installs (only 8.7 million on average), but it's still quite substantial.
