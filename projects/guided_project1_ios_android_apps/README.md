# Profitable App Profiles for the App Store and Google Play Markets

## Introduction

For this project, we'll pretend we're working as data analysts for a company that builds Android and iOS mobile apps. We make our apps available on Google Play and in the App Store.

We only build apps that are free to download and install, and our main source of revenue consists of in-app ads. This means that the number of users of our apps determines our revenue for any given app â€” the more users who see and engage with the ads, the better. Our goal for this project is to analyze data to help our developers understand what type of apps are likely to attract more users.

## Data Files

This project includes the following data files:

- `Data/AppleStore.csv`: Contains the dataset used for the iOS App Store analysis.
- `Data/googleplaystore.csv`: Contains the dataset used for the Google Play Store analysis.

### Instructions

1. Download or clone this repository.
2. Ensure that the data files are located in the `Data/` directory.
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook `Guided_project1 - ios_android_apps.ipynb` and run the cells to reproduce the analysis.

### Project Notebook

You can also directly view or run the analysis in the [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/timmueller0/data_projects_misc/blob/main/projects/guided_project1_ios_android_apps/Guided_project1%20-%20ios_android_apps.ipynb).
