# Storytelling Data Visualization on Exchange Rates

In this project we want to apply some of our new data visualisation skills to a dataset containing the exchange rates between the US Dollar and the Euro. 

Daria Chemkaeva put together the data set of exchange rates of the Euro against many other currencies and made it available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lsind18/euro-exchange-daily-rates-19992020?resource=download) — the data source is the European Central Bank. Note that the dataset gets regular updates — this version is from January 2021.

## Data Files

This project includes the following data files:

- `Data/euro-daily-hist_1999_2022.csv`: Contains the analysis dataset.

### Instructions

1. Download or clone this repository.
2. Ensure that the data files are located in the `Data/` directory.
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook `ios_android_apps.ipynb` and run the cells to reproduce the analysis.

### Project Notebook

You can also directly view or run the analysis in the [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/timmueller0/data_projects_misc/blob/main/projects/guided_project5_exchange_rates_and_qe/Guided%20project%205%20-%20Exchange%20rates%20and%20QE.ipynb)
