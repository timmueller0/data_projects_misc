# Finding the best two markets to advertise in

Let's assume that we're working for an an e-learning company that offers courses on programming. Most of our courses are on web and mobile development, but we also cover many other domains, like data science, game development, etc. We want to promote our product and we'd like to invest some money in advertisement. Our goal in this project is to find out the two best markets to advertise our product in.

We can try to search existing data that might be relevant for our purpose. One good candidate is the data from [freeCodeCamp's 2017 New Coder Survey](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/we-asked-20-000-people-who-they-are-and-how-theyre-learning-to-code-fff5d668969). [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) is a free e-learning platform that offers courses on web development. Because they run a [popular Medium publication](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/) (over 400,000 followers), their survey attracted new coders with varying interests (not only web development), which is ideal for the purpose of our analysis.

The survey data is publicly available in this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/2017-new-coder-survey).
