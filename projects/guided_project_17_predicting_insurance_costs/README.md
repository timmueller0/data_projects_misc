# Predicting Insurance Costs

For this project, we'll be looking at the [Medical Cost Data Set](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mirichoi0218/insurance?resource=download) from Kaggle. This dataset contains information on individual medical insurance bills. Each bill is associated with some demographic and personal characteristics of the person who received it.

For our regression problem, we're interested in how these different characteristics relate to the total medical cost. For this project, we want to construct the best possible predictive model for the cost, given some information about the patient. Predicting medical costs is an important task because it allows hospitals to predict revenue and plan necessary procedures needed by its patient population.
