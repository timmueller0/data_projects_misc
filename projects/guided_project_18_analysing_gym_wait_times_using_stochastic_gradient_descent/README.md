# Analysing Gym Wait Times Using Stochastic Gradient Descent

An interesting application of the Sotchastic Gradient Descent can be the analysis of waiting times at the gym. When are the best hours to go to the gym so that you avoid the crowds? We will use the “Crowdedness at the Campus Gym” dataset, which contains historic information about how crowded the campus gym is on a given day and hour, as well as other specific information about the specific days.

## Data Files

This project includes the following data files:

- `crowdness_gym_data.csv`: Gym Dataset

### Instructions

1. Download or clone this repository.
2. Ensure that the data files are located in the `Data/` directory.
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook `Guided_project_18 - Analysing Gym Wait Times Using Stochastic Gradient Descent.ipynb` and run the cells to reproduce the analysis.

### Project Notebook

You can also directly view or run the analysis in the [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/timmueller0/data_projects_misc/blob/main/projects/guided_project_18_analysing_gym_wait_times_using_stochastic_gradient_descent/Guided_project_18%20-%20Analysing%20Gym%20Wait%20Times%20Using%20Stochastic%20Gradient%20Descent.ipynb)
