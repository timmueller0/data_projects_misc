# Analysis of a Star Wars Survey

In this project, we re-analyse survey data that had been collected by the [FiveThirtyEight](http://fivethirtyeight.com/) team in order to find out about which Star Wars movies liked best and which were their most (or least) favourite characters. The article written about the data can be found [here](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/americas-favorite-star-wars-movies-and-least-favorite-characters/), and the dataset itself can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/star-wars-survey).
