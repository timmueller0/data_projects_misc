# Visualizing migration related news in Germany 2023 from newspaper headlines (2023)

The headlines come from a database, which tracks newspaper articles in German nationwide
and regional newspapers. I drew a sample of two days per week, for which all search results for the search string "migration",
published in the German press and relating to Germany, were retrieved. The article content itself is not available,
newspaper information and headlines are.
I saved the sampled search results as text files. This file shows the process of data cleaning and visualizing the
content of the headlines as word clouds (complete year and monthly).
