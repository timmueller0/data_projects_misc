# data_projects_misc
A variety of smaller data science projects

In this repository I am collecting a number of tutorial based [learning projects](https://www.dataquest.io/) and smaller data explorations. I will gradually add projects here and later create separate repositories for bigger standalone projects. This description will be updated.

### Projects:

- [iOS and Android Apps Analysis](projects/guided_project1_ios_android_apps/README.md)
- [Hacker News Posts Analysis](projects/guided_project2_hacker_news_posts/README.md)
- [eBay Car Sales Exploration](https://github.com/timmueller0/data_projects_misc/blob/main/projects/guided_project3_ebay_car_sales/README.md)
- [Analysing Traffic on the Interstate 94 (I-94) Highway](https://github.com/timmueller0/data_projects_misc/blob/main/projects/guided_project4_i-94_traffic_volume/README.md)
- [Storytelling Data Visualization on Exchange Rates](https://github.com/timmueller0/data_projects_misc/blob/main/projects/guided_project5_exchange_rates_and_qe/README.md)
